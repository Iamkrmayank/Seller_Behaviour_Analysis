"Seller Behavior Analysis" typically refers to the study or analysis of the actions, decisions, and patterns exhibited by sellers in a marketplace or business environment. 
This analysis often involves examining various factors such as pricing strategies, product offerings, marketing efforts, customer interactions, and competitor behavior 
to understand how sellers operate and how they impact the market dynamics.

The objectives of seller behavior analysis can vary depending on the context, but some common goals include:

Understanding Market Trends: Analyzing seller behavior can provide insights into broader market trends, such as shifts in consumer preferences, 
emerging product categories, or changes in competitive dynamics.

Optimizing Pricing Strategies: By studying how sellers set prices for their products or services, businesses can identify optimal pricing strategies to maximize 
profitability while remaining competitive in the market.

Identifying Opportunities and Threats: Analysis of seller behavior can help businesses identify potential opportunities for growth, as
well as threats from competitors or market disruptions.
